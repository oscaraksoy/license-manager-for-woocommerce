Easily sell and manage software license keys through your WooCommerce shop

== Description ==
The **License Manager for WooCommerce** allows you to easily sell and manage all of your digital license keys. With features like the bulk importer, automatic delivery, and database encryption, your shop will now run easier than ever.

#### Plugin features

* Automatically sell and deliver license keys through WooCommerce
* Add a single license key and assign it to a specific product
* Add multiple license keys (by file upload) and assign them to a specific product
* Manage the status of your license keys
* Create license key generators with custom parameters
* Assign a generator to one (or more!) WooCommerce product(s), these products then automatically create a license key whenever they are sold

#### API

The plugin also offers two additional routes for manipulating licenses and generator resources. These routes are authorized via API keys (generated through the plugin settings) and accessed via the WordPress API. Here you can [download the Postman collection](https://www.bebic.at/assets/lmfwc.postman_collection.json) (v2.1) for these new routes. An extensive [API documentation](https://www.bebic.at/license-manager-for-woocommerce/apidocs) is also available on the plugin homepage.

#### Support

If you have any feature requests, need more hooks, or maybe have even found a bug, please let us know in the support forum or e-mail us at <licensemanager@bebic.at>. We look forward to hearing from you!

#### Important

The plugin will create two files inside the `wp-content/uploads/lmfwc-files` folder. These files (`defuse.txt` and `secret.txt`) contain cryptographic secrets which are automatically generated if they don't exist. These cryptographic secrets are used to encrypt, decrypt and hash your license keys. Once they are generated please **back them up somewhere safe**. In case you lose these two files your encrypted license keys inside the database will remain forever lost!

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 1.1.1 =
Copy your previously backed up `defuse.txt` and `secret.txt` to the `wp-content/uploads/lmfwc-files/` folder. Overwrite the existing files, as those are incompatible with the keys you already have in your database. If you did not backup these files previously, then you will need to completely delete (not deactivate!) and install the plugin anew.

= 1.0.0 =
There is no specific upgrade process for the initial release. Simply install the plugin and you're good to go!
