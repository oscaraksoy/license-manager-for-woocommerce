### Important

The plugin will create two files inside its own `assets/etc` folder. These files (`defuse.txt` and `secret.txt`) contain cryptographic secrets which are automatically generated if they don't exist. These cryptographic secrets are used to encrypt, decrypt and hash your license keys. Once they are generated please **back them up somewhere safe**. In case you lose these two files your encrypted license keys inside the database will remain forever lost!
